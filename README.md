### o1: @insert, @select, @update, @delete using annotations

### o2: nomal @Results and One-to-one nested select

I gave up on practicing annotations because:

1. mybatis annotations have limitations, like nested resultMaps have to be implemented with XML
2. mybatis annotations do not bring much convinice or type-safe check
3. XML is preferred by many programmers

Dynamic SQL is not very useful and I doubt I will use it any time soon so I will skip.
